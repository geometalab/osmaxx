# Project Development Environment (Docker)

## Local prerequisites

Docker and docker-compose is required to be installed.

For committing and using the pre-commit hook (which really should be used) flake8 needs to be installed on
the local system/machine.

For Ubuntu and Debian this is:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-flake8
```

Then the pre-commit hook can be linked to the hooks.

```shell
cd <osmaxx-repo-root>
ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```


## Using the project docker setup

A docker-compose setup is provided as part of this project's repository. Ensure to have docker installed
and setup the containers properly, as described in the README.


## Running commands

The general way of running any command inside a docker container:

```shell
docker-compose run <container> <command>
```

Examples:

Execute a shell in the webapp:
```shell
docker-compose run osmaxxwebappdev /bin/bash
```


## Run all tests
(Requires Python 3 on the host.)

```shell
./runtests.py
```

To run the application tests only, see [Commonly used commands while developing / Run tests](useful-commands.md#run-tests).


## Access the application

`http://<your_ip>:8000`

where `<your_ip>` is your (public) IP as reported by
```bash
ip route get 1 | awk '{print $NF;exit}'
```

or add

```txt
127.0.0.1	osmaxx.dev
```

to your `/etc/hosts` file and access by

[http://osmaxx.dev:8000](http://osmaxx.dev:8000)

## Enable development with debug toolbar enabled

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, add a line containing the content of the command:
```
echo $(ip -4 addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+')
```

Add that to the docker-compose.yml:

```
webappdev:
   ...
   environment:
   ...
    - DJANGO_INTERNAL_IPS=172.17.42.1 # IP from the command above
```
### Note: More automatic in docker-compose 1.5
Once **docker-compose 1.5** or better is being used, you can simplify this process by letting docker-compose evaluate the command for you:

See https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/1765.

Then one should be able to use:

`- DJANGO_INTERNAL_IPS=$(ip -4 addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+')`

## Reset the box

Normally, just stopping the containers, removing them and updating them is enough:

```shell
docker-compose stop # shutdown all containers
# to force shutdown: docker-compose kill
docker-compose rm -f
docker-compose build

# run migrations and create super user, commands see in README
```


If it should be rebuilt from scratch, destroy the boxes and start over.
Replace the step `docker-compose build` above with `docker-compose build --no-cache`.

**NOTICE**: This might not be what you want; you rebuild single images using
`docker-compose build --no-cache <imagename>`, so for example, rebuilding the webapp would be
`docker-compose build --no-cache osmaxxwebappdev`.


## Useful Docker commands

Save docker image to file:
```shell
docker save osmaxx_osmaxxdatabase > /tmp/osmaxx-database-alpha1.docker-img.tar
docker save osmaxx_osmaxxwebapp > /tmp/osmaxx-webapp-alpha1.docker-img.tar
```

Load docker image from file:
```shell
docker load < /tmp/osmaxx-database-alpha1.docker-img.tar
docker load < /tmp/osmaxx-database-alpha1.docker-img.tar
```
## Emails sending

Emails during development and testing can be found locally under `/tmp/osmaxx-development-emails`. 
This directory holds all sent emails.

If you should find yourself in need of changing the email settings, please
have a look at the django settings for emails: 
[Django email settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#email-backend)

To change them, append `DJANGO_` to the settings name and add it to the environment in the `compose-development.yml`.

The following list ist supported:

```
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_FILE_PATH=/dev-emails
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST=localhost
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=''
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER=''
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_PORT=25
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX='[OSMAXX-DEV] '
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_USE_TLS=False
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_USE_SSL=False
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_TIMEOUT=None
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILET=None
    - DJANGO_EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE=None
```
